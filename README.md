# Instructions

In this exercise you're going to write some code to help you cook a brilliant lasagna from your favorite cooking book.

You have four tasks, all related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.

1. Define the expected oven time in minutes
   - According to the cooking book, the expected oven time in minutes is `40`.
   - It returns how many minutes the lasagna should be in the oven.
2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes
   - It takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as a parameter.
   - It returns how many minutes the lasagna still has to remain in the oven.
3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes
   - It takes the number of layers you added to the lasagna as a parameter.
   - It returns how many minutes you spent preparing the lasagna, assuming each layer takes you `2` minutes to prepare.
4. Calculate the total working time in minutes
   - It takes two parameters: the first parameter is the number of layers you added to the lasagna, and the second parameter is the number of minutes the lasagna has been in the oven.
   - It returns how many minutes in total you've worked on cooking the lasagna, which is the sum of the preparation time in minutes, and the time in minutes the lasagna has spent in the oven at the moment.
